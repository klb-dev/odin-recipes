    <p>Taco Salad is a classic recipe everyone should know how to make. This version is quick, flavorful, hearty, a total breeze to make and it’s a dinner everyone can agree on both young and old alike!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ul-container">
        <li class="ing-list">Olive oil – for sautéing</li>
        <li class="ing-list">Lean ground beef – I like to use 85% lean Angus beef.</li>
        <li class="ing-list">Roasted salsa – I prefer the lightly charred depth of fire roasted salsa here but just about any bottled salsa will work (do skip the fruity ones here though).</li>
        <li class="ing-list">Chili powder and cumin – these standard Mexican spices add lots of flavor.</li>
        <li class="ing-list">Salt and pepper – what would food be without it?</li>
        <li class="ing-list">Cilantro – the cilantro gives the filling the perfect fresh finish</li>
        <li class="ing-list">Lettuce – I think romaine is the best lettuce for taco salad but iceberg, green leaf or even spinach will work too.</li>
        <li class="ing-list">Tortilla chips, Mexican cheese, tomatoes, avocado, sour cream – all these toppings together create the perfect blend of textures and flavors to compliment the beef.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="ol-container">
        <li class="num-list">Heat olive oil in a 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li class="num-list">Crumble in beef in chunks. Let sear until browned on bottom, about 3 minutes then turn and break up beef and continue to cookie until cooked through.</li>
        <li class="num-list">Drain fat from beef then stir in salsa, chili powder and cumin. Season with salt and pepper to taste and heat through, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li class="num-list">Layer lettuce among individual plates. Top with chips, beef mixture, cheese, tomatoes, avocado and sour cream. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
